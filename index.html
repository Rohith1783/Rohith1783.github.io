<p>This might sound unrealistic, but ABB made it come true. While in rest of the world the auto manufacturers were busy developing the a car which could charge in minutes, ABB made it possible in seconds.</p><br>
<p>In Switzerland ABB recieved an order from Tosa (a transit bus operator) for their 15 seconds, 600 kilowatt flash charge technology. this technology was to be installed in the route number 23, which is from suburban Geneva and the airport.</p><br>
<p>This charging technology was made possible by the use of supercapacitors (also known as ultracapacitors). This draws the low voltage current and stores it and releases the energy stored instantaneously. This makes it possible for the buses to get a top up in seconds and then the buses also uses the solar energy as the buses are only run in day times. The roll out of its initial fleet was in 2018.</p><br>
<p>It is already competitive with diesel powered buses. The fuel costs are increasing day by day with drop in energy stored costs.</p><br>
<p>The India's great Ashok Leyland and ABB have signed aMoU (Memorundum of Understanding). According to this both are going to work on the ashok leyland buses to install the 600-kilowatt flash charge technology</p><br>
<p>This will promote the e-mobility in the country and will also encourage others to use e-vehicles.</p>
